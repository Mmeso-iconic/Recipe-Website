## Introduction

Recipe Finder uses the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) to fetch meal data based on user input. It was created to strengthen skills in JavaScript, working with external APIs, and dynamic DOM manipulation. The application displays each meal in a card format with an image, title, description, ingredients list, and a YouTube video link for the full recipe.
